# Jet Lag (In-progress)

## Description

After travelling from the UK to NYC this summer to study at The Flatiron School I encountered a problem with my Twitter feed on both the web and iOS app. NYC is 5 hours behind London and the majority of people that I follow on Twitter are UK-based. This means that when I get to the evening and I have a chance to check Twitter I have to scroll back through my feed for ages to get to the start of that day's events.

Jet Lag is a Rails app that aims to solve this problem. You simply log in via Twitter and then specify a certain number of hours that you'd like to go back. Et voil√†. No mad scrolling necessary.

## Development/Contribution

Whilst the MVP of this app is still under development I'd appreciate people holding off on the pull requests for now ;)

## Future

Currently building the MVP but would like to integrate the following:

-- Add images to tweet body
-- Sortable results using jQuery
-- Functionality to be able to set timezone or have it deteced automatically
